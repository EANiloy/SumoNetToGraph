# SumoNetToGraph
This small code is used to visualize a sumo network file as a directed graph with the distance of the roads as the weights of the edges.


# Requirements
To run the code you need Networkx, Matplotlib, and ElementTree. All of them are by default installed if not you can pip install them.

# Inital Commit
The code is tested with a very small road network.
